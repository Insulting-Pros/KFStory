!> If you are a server owner, double check if you are distributing **Karma** files with **[Music downloader]**. Or ask your clients to manually install them. Else they will **crash** in 100% cases.

!> Original version is bugged and unbalanced to hell. Install **EITHER** the [Fix V3](#Toy-Master-Fix-V3) **OR** the [Fix V4](#Toy-Master-Fix-V4) on top of it, save your nerves.

In a free, add-on mod for Killing Floor, created by David Hensley (with help from Killing Floor originator, [Alex Quick]), you can fight off the bizarre and warped toys of someone's nightmare, that are hell-bent on finishing you off. All the standard Zeds are replaced with evil toys, set in the Devil's Dollhouse map Â©
