!> Map lists are **HUGE**, I've spent many days sorting files, creating categories and filling all the information at right spots. So there can be some typos, missing maps and disinformation. If you find any please contact me: [Github Issues] or [KillingFloor.ru PM].

## About

I adore **Killing Floor 1** story maps and greatly respect all the work, time that their authors put into their creations. So I aimed to create a place where everyone can easily find, compare, download and install any map in few clicks. Enjoy.

## General Info

* Maps are categorized by gametypes (map prefixes).
* Most usefull and not broken maps are on top of the list. Yeah I sorted them by my taste, v52.
* All downloaded archives have **redirect** (*.uz2) files in them. Don't thank me.
* All list entries follow the same format:
  * **Title**: map name.
  * **Authors**: one or more.
  * **Map filename**: with prefix ofc.
  * **Links**: starting from DL then Workshop, Forum, ModDb, Site, if there are any.
  * **Notes**: a special section for greylisted maps or when I need to warn you about gamebreaking stuff / [CustomSpawnFix].
  * **Clickable screenshots**: to easily recognize the maps.

Some maps can work in KFO mode if you rename their prefix, aka `KF- / KFS- / TOY-` to `KFO-`.

* kf-Arcade-Mission-v2
* KF-Hokuto_Ujou_Hagan_Ken_v2
* KF-LaserChallengeV3
* KF-Offices-Story-alpha1
* KF-roofhop
* KF-SaarV5
* KF-Strangev12
* KF-TheHiveV1REV3
* KF-TheHiveV2FC
* KF-TheHiveV3Beta
* TOY-DevilsDollhouse
* TOY-DevilsDollhouse-FixV3
* can be more, test yourself if you want.

## Map Packages

!> Always keep [CustomSpawnFix] around, it will help greatly if you have invisible zeds. Thanks Tripwire for renaming zed classes in latest patches and breaking old story maps.

!> Avoid [NetReduce] and [NetReduceSE] at all costs, or you will get broken spawns, pickups, missing keys, switches, etc etc.

These packages are **Whitelisted**, if you see them don't worry:

* [ScrnStoryGame] - adds many and many additional scripts, npc support, dialoges, etc.
* [FoundryObj] - a bit more scripts ^.
* [KFChaingunTurret] - a usable gatling gun.
* [Fall_TriggerPack] - one of the oldest ones around, has few usefull triggers.
* [KFGasCan] - gas can and related scripts.
* [clientmaterialtrigger] - allows to change materials for clients.

**[DMN666]**: his original [thread](https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/kf-game-modes-and-maps.101777/) helped me a lot when I started this project. Without him this thread wouldn't exist.

**KillingFloor.ru** and staff: this forum was a great host for my initial [thread](http://killingfloor.ru/xforum/threads/kf-story-gametypes-i-karty-k-nim.4219/).
