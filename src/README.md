> Map lists are **HUGE**. A lot of days were spent sorting files, creating categories and filling in all the information in the right places. So there can be typos, missing maps, links, credits and false information. If you find any, please let us know: [GitHub Issues] / [Discord](https://discord.gg/eREYb3AgeT).

## General Info

Ola! I adore **Killing Floor 1** story maps and greatly respect all the work, time that their authors put into their creations. So I aimed to create a place where everyone can easily find, compare, download and install any map in a few clicks. Enjoy.

* Maps are categorized by gametypes (map prefixes).
* Most useful, not broken maps are on top of the list. Yeah I sorted them by my taste, v52.
* All archives have **redirect** (*.uz2) files in them. Don't thank me.
* All archives are made by [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) with following settings:

|Variable           |Value    |
|---                |---      |
|Archive format     |zip      |
|Compression level  |Ultra    |
|Compression method |Deflate  |
|Dictionary size    |32 KB    |
|Word size          |258      |

This allow archives to be opened in windows explorer. I could go for `*.rar` or `*.7z` instead, but size savings are not that significant, and end users must have 3rd party apps to open them. So not worth it imo.

* All list entries follow the same format:
  * **Title**: map name.
  * **Authors**: one or more, with [links to user accounts](./tech/Links.md#map-authors) (if there are any).
  * **Map filename**: with prefix ofc.
  * **Links**: starting from DL then Workshop, Forum, ModDb, Site (if there are any).
  * **Notes**: a special section for greylisted maps or when I need to warn you about game breaking stuff / [CustomSpawnFix].
  * **Clickable screenshots**: to easily recognize the maps. Except some old, exported JPG's, these are [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) optimized PNG's.
