# Credits

**[DMN666]**: his original [thread](https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/kf-game-modes-and-maps.101777/) helped me a lot when I started this project. Without him this thread wouldn't exist.

**KillingFloor.ru** and staff: this forum was a great host for my initial [thread (Wayback Machine)](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://killingfloor.ru/xforum/threads/kf-story-gametypes-i-karty-k-nim.4219/).

**[atagene]**: thanks for a nice [logo](https://www.deviantart.com/atagene/art/Killing-Floor-Text-522558359)!
